# bookbot
BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

A data analysis program that evaluates information about books; a guided boot.dev project.

main.py outputs, in a well-structured format, the number of appearances per alphabetic character in a given document, as well as word count.
