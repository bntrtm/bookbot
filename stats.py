# PERSONAL NOTE: PYTHON LAMBDAS
# A lambda is an anonymous, one-line function in Python. The general syntax is:
#
# lambda argument: result
#
# So, see the following:
#
# dict_list.sort(key=lambda x: x["count"], reverse=True)
#
# This tells Python:
#
# 1. For each x in the list dict_list, look at the "count" value: x["count"].
# 2. Sort the list based on that "count" value, in descending order (reverse=True).
#
# The lambda x: x["count"] part is what determines how to compare the itemsâ€”it extracts the "count" value for each dictionary.
